# UofL-Web-Scraper
UofL Web Scraper

This is my first web scraping project where I scraped different UofL events websites and filtered for eventst that were giving out free food or items. It takes the event name, location, and date and sends it to users via whatsapp/discord.

Version 2 Update:
Due to changes in UofLs event calendar webpage version 2 of the web scraping project will take day of events and then filter them based on keywords found in their summary. It will primarily message the events through discord.
